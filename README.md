# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
This repository contains the code files for the getting &amp; cleaning data course, final week assignment.

Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project: Week 4, Peer-Graded Assignment
This readme file has the instructions to run analysis on the given dataset using the files in this repository.

Dataset used: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files:
CodeBook.md is the code book that describes the variables, the dataset & the other necessary tools to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R performs the required data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps described in the course project goals:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the final text data file.
